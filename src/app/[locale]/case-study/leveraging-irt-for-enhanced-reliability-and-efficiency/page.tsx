                Infrared Thermography (IRT) has emerged as a cornerstone
                technology in modern predictive maintenance programs across
                industries. By utilizing thermal imaging to monitor equipment
                condition and diagnose errors, IRT provides unprecedented
                visibility into the operational health of critical industrial
                assets. Over the past two decades, the accessibility of this
                technology has improved dramatically as equipment costs have
                decreased, making IRT an increasingly popular tool for
                maintenance professionals.

                SETECH SERVICE, a leading industrial solutions provider, has
                established itself as a specialist in implementing IRT programs
                that deliver tangible improvements in reliability and
                efficiency. Their approach combines advanced technology with
                deep domain expertise to help industrial organizations transform
                their maintenance strategies from reactive to predictive.

              The Power of Predictive Visibility

              <span>
                The potential for improving maintenance efficiency through IRT
                monitoring is described as virtually limitless. Industrial
                manufacturers who have systematically applied this technology
                report benefits that consistently exceed their expectations.
                These include significant reductions in operating and
                maintenance costs, elimination of unexpected operational
                problems, enhanced equipment protection, measurable energy and
                fuel savings, and notable improvements in overall production
                efficiency.
              </span>
              <span>
                What makes IRT particularly valuable is its non-invasive nature
                and broad applicability across diverse equipment types. A single
                technology investment can deliver insights across multiple asset
                classes, creating a comprehensive view of plant thermal
                conditions without disrupting operations.

              Versatile Applications Across Industrial Equipment

              <span>
                The versatility of IRT makes it an invaluable tool across
                numerous equipment categories. Maintenance teams employ
                thermographic inspections to monitor and diagnose issues in
                rotating equipment such as fans, motors, compressors,
                generators, turbines, centrifuges, rollers, and flywheels—where
                bearing failures, misalignment, or lubrication issues manifest
                as thermal anomalies before audible or vibration symptoms
                appear.
              </span>
              <span>
                For static and fluid flow equipment including piping, valves,
                filters, tanks, vessels, heat exchangers, separators, reactors,
                pressure relief devices, and conveyors, IRT can identify
                blockages, leaks, insulation failures, and flow distribution
                problems. In electrical systems, from motors and transformers to
                inverters, protection devices, and low-voltage terminations,
                thermal imaging can detect loose connections, overloads,
                imbalances, and component degradation before catastrophic
                failures occur.

              <span>
                Perhaps the most sophisticated application of IRT is in the
                diagnosis of fired heaters, furnaces, and boilers—critical,
                energy-intensive assets where failures can have catastrophic
                consequences. SETECH's thermal camera surveys provide a
                comprehensive evaluation of these systems, optimizing production
                output and fuel economy, enhancing safety, avoiding premature
                shutdowns, and improving turnaround efficiency.
              </span>
              <span>
                These specialized inspections can detect a wide range of
                conditions that might otherwise remain hidden: coke build-up and
                internal fouling, excessive scale on heat exchange surfaces,
                burner problems, flame impingement, imbalanced heating, dry
                zones in tubes, thermocouple malfunctions, air leakage, steam
                system issues, and structural failures like broken tube guides
                or defective supports. By identifying these issues early, plants
                can address problems before they escalate into costly failures
                or safety incidents.
