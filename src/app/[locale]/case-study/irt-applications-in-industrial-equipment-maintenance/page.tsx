              IRT Applications in Industrial Equipment Maintenance

                Infrared Thermography (IRT), also known simply as thermography,
                has established itself as a cornerstone technology in predictive
                maintenance programs across most industrial sectors. This
                non-invasive method utilizes thermal imaging to monitor
                equipment condition and diagnose potential issues before they
                develop into costly failures. Over the past two decades, the
                accessibility of IRT has improved dramatically as equipment
                costs have decreased, making this powerful diagnostic tool
                increasingly common in maintenance departments worldwide.

              <span>
                The potential for enhancing maintenance efficiency and
                effectiveness through thermal monitoring is considered virtually
                limitless by industry experts. Manufacturing facilities that
                have systematically implemented IRT technology consistently
                report benefits that exceed initial expectations, including
                reduced downtime, extended equipment life, and significant cost
                savings through early intervention.

                One of the most valuable aspects of thermographic inspection is
                its versatility across diverse equipment categories. A single
                technology investment can provide diagnostic insights for
                multiple critical asset types, creating an integrated view of
                facility thermal conditions without disrupting operations.

                In rotating equipment such as fans, motors, compressors,
                generators, turbines, centrifuges, rollers, and flywheels,
                thermal imaging can detect bearing failures, misalignment, and
                lubrication issues before they manifest as audible or vibration
                symptoms. For static and fluid flow equipment including piping,
                valves, filters, tanks, vessels, heat exchangers, separators,
                reactors, and pressure relief devices, IRT identifies blockages,
                leaks, insulation failures, and flow distribution problems with
                remarkable precision.

              Electrical System Integrity Through Thermal Insight
            </h3>

              <span>
                Electrical systems present unique challenges for maintenance
                teams due to their complex nature and safety concerns. IRT
                offers a safe, non-contact method to assess the condition of
                electrical components while they remain energized and
                operational. From electric motors and generators to inverters,
                transformers, voltage regulators, power supply units, protection
                devices, and control systems, thermography can detect loose
                connections, overloads, imbalances, and component degradation
                before they lead to catastrophic failures.
              </span>
              <span>
                Motor Control Centers (MCCs) and low-voltage terminations are
                particularly prone to connection issues that manifest as
                localized heating—often invisible to the naked eye but clearly
                revealed through thermographic inspection. Regular thermal
                surveys of these systems can prevent unplanned outages and
                potential safety incidents while extending the operational life
                of critical electrical infrastructure.

              Advanced Applications: Fired Heaters and Process Equipment

              <span>
                Perhaps the most sophisticated application of IRT technology is
                in the diagnosis of fired heaters, furnaces, and
                boilers—critical assets where failures can have catastrophic
                consequences. Thermal camera surveys provide a comprehensive
                evaluation of these complex systems while they remain
                operational, optimizing production output and fuel economy,
                enhancing safety, preventing premature shutdowns, and improving
                turnaround efficiency.

              <span>
                These specialized inspections can detect numerous conditions
                that might otherwise remain hidden: coke build-up and internal
                fouling, excessive scale on heat exchange surfaces, burner
                problems, flame impingement, imbalanced heating, dry zones in
                tubes, thermocouple malfunctions, air leakage, steam system
                issues, afterburn problems, and structural failures such as
                broken tube guides or defective supports. By identifying these
                issues early, maintenance teams can plan interventions before
                they escalate into costly failures or safety incidents.

                While the technology behind IRT is impressive, SETECH SERVICE
                recognizes that equipment alone cannot deliver sustainable
                improvements in reliability and efficiency. That's why they
                place equal emphasis on comprehensive training programs that
                build internal capability within client organizations. Their IRT
                training courses, developed and led by Mr. Mikael Cronholm—an
                expert with over 30 years of teaching experience and 40 years of
                practical application—adhere to ISO 18436-7 standards and

                imaging technology, interpretation techniques (both qualitative
                and quantitative), and specific industrial applications. By
                investing in personnel development alongside technology

                The industrial landscape continues to evolve toward more
                data-driven, predictive approaches to maintenance and asset
                management. In this context, IRT stands out as a technology that
                bridges the gap between thermodynamic theory and practical
                maintenance decision-making. By visualizing the invisible
